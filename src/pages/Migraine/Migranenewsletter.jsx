        "Migraine medications fall into two main categories: preventive (prophylactic) and acute (abortive) treatments. Preventive medications are taken daily to reduce the frequency and severity of migraines, while acute treatments are used during a migraine attack to stop or reduce symptoms. Triptans like sumatriptan work by constricting blood vessels and blocking pain pathways. CGRP inhibitors such as erenumab represent a breakthrough in migraine prevention by targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide pathway. Beta-blockers like propranolol and anticonvulsants such as topiramate are also effective preventive options. The choice of medication depends on migraine frequency, severity, comorbid conditions, and individual response patterns.",

Keeping a detailed migraine diary helps identify personal triggers. The 'threshold theory' suggests that multiple triggers may need to combine to precipitate a migraine. Stress management through relaxation techniques, regular sleep schedules, staying hydrated, and avoiding known dietary triggers are key prevention strategies. Weather-related triggers are harder to avoid but can be anticipated with weather tracking apps.",

        "Modern migraine research has revealed that migraines are complex neurological disorders involving multiple brain systems. The trigeminal nerve system plays a crucial role, releasing inflammatory substances that cause blood vessel dilation and pain. CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) is a key player in this process, which is why CGRP inhibitors are so effective. Cortical spreading depression, a wave of electrical activity across the brain, is thought to trigger the aura phase. Genetic factors contribute significantly, with over 40 genetic variants associated with migraine susceptibility. Serotonin imbalances also play a role, explaining why some antidepressants help prevent migraines.",

However, triggers are highly individual. Beneficial foods include those rich in magnesium (leafy greens, nuts, seeds), riboflavin/B2 (dairy, eggs, lean meats), and omega-3 fatty acids (fatty fish, walnuts). Regular meal timing is crucial as skipping meals can trigger migraines. Staying well-hydrated is essential, as dehydration is a common trigger.

Symptoms include mood changes (irritability, depression, euphoria), food cravings (especially for chocolate or carbohydrates), increased urination, neck stiffness, and fatigue. About 25% of migraine sufferers experience aura, which typically occurs 20-60 minutes before the headache. Visual auras are most common, including zigzag lines, blind spots, or flashing lights. Some people experience sensory auras (tingling, numbness) or speech difficulties. Recognizing these early signs allows for prompt treatment with acute medications, which are most effective when taken early in the attack.",

These migraines are often more severe and longer-lasting than non-menstrual attacks. Treatment options include short-term prevention with triptans or NSAIDs around menstruation, or continuous hormonal contraception to minimize fluctuations. During pregnancy, many women experience improvement in migraines, especially in the second and third trimesters, but treatment options are limited. Menopause can initially worsen migraines due to erratic hormone levels, but they often improve post-menopause. Hormone replacement therapy effects vary and should be carefully monitored.",

Abdominal migraines are unique to children, presenting as recurrent abdominal pain without headache. Triggers in children commonly include stress, irregular sleep, skipped meals, and dehydration. Treatment focuses on lifestyle modifications first: regular sleep schedules, consistent meal times, stress management, and adequate hydration. Medications are used more cautiously, with ibuprofen and nasal sumatriptan approved for pediatric use.
