                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Carnie Wilson first experienced symptoms of depression in her teenage years, though she didn't
                  recognize them as such at the time. Coming from a musical family (her father is Beach Boys legend Brian
                  Wilson), mental health challenges were familiar but not always discussed openly.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  In interviews, Carnie has spoken about how her father's well-documented struggles with mental illness
                  created both awareness and fear about her own mental health:

                  <li>Witnessing mental health crises in childhood</li>
                  <li>Pressure of growing up in the public eye</li>
                  <li>Using food as emotional comfort from an early age</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  Carnie's experience highlights how mental health challenges often have both biological and
                  environmental components.
